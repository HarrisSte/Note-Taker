## Contributors

There was a great deal of research done to complete this project. Part of that research was reading through the documentations for Node and Inquirer. I also read through materials and articles fom W3Schools, MDN, StackOverflow, and class resources provided by the bootcamp. I also recieved assistance from my TA instuctors during office hours to help with troubleshooting. I recieved guidance from my classmates and colleague, Andrew Zimmerman, when I was working through the testing process.
